# Nikola Tesla: A Visionary Inventor

Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, engineer, and futurist best known for his revolutionary contributions to electricity and magnetism. He developed technologies and ideas that laid the groundwork for modern power systems and many other innovations.

## Early Life
- **Born:** July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, in modern-day Croatia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire).
- Tesla's father was a priest, and his mother, although uneducated formally, was highly inventive, influencing his early curiosity.

## Key Contributions
1. **Alternating Current (AC) System:**  
   Tesla championed AC over Thomas Edison's direct current (DC) system. AC became the global standard for power transmission due to its efficiency over long distances.

2. **Tesla Coil:**  
   Invented in 1891, the Tesla coil is a high-frequency transformer used in radios, televisions, and wireless transmission experiments.

3. **Wireless Communication:**  
   Tesla envisioned wireless communication long before it became a reality. He experimented with transmitting energy without wires and laid the groundwork for modern wireless technology.

4. **Induction Motor:**  
   Tesla's invention of the AC induction motor was critical to the development of modern electrical engineering.

5. **X-rays and Remote Control:**  
   Tesla was among the early pioneers of X-ray imaging and demonstrated the first remote-controlled boat in 1898.

## Later Years
Tesla was known for his eccentric personality and a habit of working obsessively on his inventions. Despite his brilliance, he faced financial struggles and was overshadowed by contemporaries like Edison and Westinghouse. He spent his final years in relative obscurity, living in New York City, and died in 1943.

## Legacy
Today, Tesla is celebrated as a visionary. His name is associated with innovation, and the Tesla electric car company, founded by Elon Musk, honors his contributions to science and technology. Many of his ideas, such as wireless energy and global communications, were far ahead of his time.
